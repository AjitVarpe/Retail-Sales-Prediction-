# Retail-Sales-Prediction
Supervised ML-Regression
In the following project, we have applied machine learning to a real world problem of predicting retail stores sales. Such predictions help store managers in creating effective staff schedules that increase productivity. We used the popular open source programming language Python and used its libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas , matplotlib for modelling, analysis and prediction and visualization. We used feature selection, model selection to improve our prediction result. In view of the nature of our problem, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used to measure the prediction accuracy. 


Challenges: 
Handling large amount of sales data (10,17,210 observations on 13 variables). <br> 
Prediction of Sales for individual store (out of 1115)and most of stores have different pattern of sales. A single model cannot fit to all stores.
