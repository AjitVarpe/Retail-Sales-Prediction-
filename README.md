# Retail-Sales-Prediction-
We have generated sales predictions for the Rossmann store chain 6 weeks in advance using regression models. While conducting EDA for modeling, we found many interesting insights. Although many stores were closed on Sunday, those that were opened saw a great amount of sales revenue. Assortment b had the highest sales, but it was only available in tybe-b stores among 4 types of store in total. We hope that these findings will be helpful for business decision-makers to optimize their profits. Rossmann stores should focus on opening and operating stores with the aim of increasing customer count. The associated factors could be visibility, population density etc. Competition’s nearness adversely affects sales and thus the location of store should accordingly be chosen.

Challenges: 
Handling large amount of sales data (10,17,210 observations on 13 variables). <br> <br>
Prediction of Sales for individual store (out of 1115)and most of stores have different pattern of sales. A single model cannot fit to all stores.
